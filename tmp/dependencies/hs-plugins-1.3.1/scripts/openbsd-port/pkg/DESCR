hs-plugins is a library for dynamic loading and compilation of Haskell
code. It provides typesafe "plugins" for Haskell.  The interface is
general enough that it can be used to create conventional plugins,
hmake-like Haskell interpreters embedded in applications, or to script
an application with Haskell (or a Haskell EDSL) as the extension
language.
