This little application is an example of using hs-plugins to embed a Haskell
'interpreter' inside an Objective-C, Cocoa-based program.  You will need Mac OS
X for this to be of any use!

To build it, type 'make', which will build a .app bundle in the build/ directory.  Or, 'open *.xcode', and hit the build button in there.
