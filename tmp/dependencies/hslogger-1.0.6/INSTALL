INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
For Linux, Unix, BSD, and POSIX platforms
=========================================

Please see the file INSTALL-win.txt for Windows platform instructions.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You must satisfy one or more of these major categories:

1. GHC 6.6 or above (including cpphs)

2. Hugs 2005xx or above, plus cpphs

   If you don't already have cpphs, get it from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/cpphs/.

If you need Cabal, get it from http://www.haskell.org/cabal.

Debian users can install the packages cpphs and ghc6

3. GHC extralibs collection, or mtl from
   http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/unstable/mtl/

INSTALLATION
------------

The first step is to generate your setup file.  To do that, run:

  make setup

Now, for GHC:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install

Or, for Hugs:

 ./setup configure --hugs
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
 
Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test-ghc6

or:

 make test-hugs
