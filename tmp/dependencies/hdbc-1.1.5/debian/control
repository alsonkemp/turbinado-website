Description: Haskell Database Connectivity, GHC6 package
 HDBC provides an abstraction layer between Haskell programs and SQL
 relational databases. This lets you write database code once, in
 Haskell, and have it work with any number of backend SQL databases
 (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, ODBC-compliant databases, etc.)
 .
 HDBC is modeled loosely on Perl's DBI interface, though it has also been
 influenced by Python's DB-API v2, JDBC in Java, and HSQL in Haskell.
 .
 To use HDBC, you'll need both this package, and a driver package such
 as libghc6-hdbc-postgresql-dev.
